# Cheat Sheet Collection - Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow for the Cheat Sheet Collection project.

## Development Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd cheatsheet-collection
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .  # Install package in development mode
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Understanding the Project

- Read the `README.md` for project overview
- Review the `architecture.md` to understand the system design
- Check `docs/` for detailed documentation

### 2. Selecting a Task

- Check the GitHub issues or the TODO section in the architecture document
- Select a task appropriate to your experience level
- Assign yourself to the issue if using GitHub

### 3. Implementation Process

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Review requirements** and ensure you understand the task at hand

3. **Design your solution**:
   - Map out how your implementation fits within the architecture
   - Consider edge cases and error handling
   - Plan for testing

4. **Implementation**:
   - Write code following the project's style guidelines
   - Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules
   - Include type hints for better code understanding

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for your new functionality
   - Ensure existing tests still pass
   - Run test suite with:
     ```bash
     python -m pytest
     ```

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update relevant documentation to reflect your changes
   - Add examples if implementing user-facing features

7. **Code review preparation**:
   - Review your own code for quality and correctness
   - Ensure tests pass and documentation is updated
   - Verify your code meets the project's standards

### 4. Submission Process

1. **Commit your changes** with meaningful commit messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement feature X to solve problem Y"
   ```

2. **Push your branch** to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a pull request** with the following information:
   - Clear description of the changes
   - Reference to the issue it resolves
   - Any special considerations for testing

4. **Address review feedback** if changes are requested

5. **Once approved**, merge your pull request

### 5. Continuous Maintenance

- Update documentation as the project evolves
- Refactor code when necessary to maintain quality
- Ensure test coverage for all new features

## Coding Standards

### Style Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length of 88 characters (compatible with Black formatter)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Documentation Guidelines

- All modules should have a module-level docstring explaining purpose
- All functions and classes should have docstrings following Google docstring format:
  ```python
  def function_name(param1, param2):
      """Short description of function.
      
      Longer description explaining details.
      
      Args:
          param1: Description of param1
          param2: Description of param2
          
      Returns:
          Description of return value
          
      Raises:
          ExceptionType: When and why this exception is raised
      """
  ```

- Comment complex sections of code, but prefer readable code over excessive comments

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for core functionality
- Use descriptive test names that explain the test's purpose
- Structure tests with Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

## Git Workflow

- Use feature branches for all changes
- Keep commits focused and logical
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Rebase feature branches on main before creating pull requests

## Release Process

1. Update version number in `setup.py`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
3. Create a release tag in Git
4. Build and publish package

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during development:

1. Check the project documentation
2. Review relevant tests for examples
3. Reach out to other contributors if needed
